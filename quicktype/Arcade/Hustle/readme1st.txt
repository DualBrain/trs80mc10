                           Hustle and Color Hustle

This is a port of Hustle to the MC-10 from the TRS-80 Model 1/3/4 line of
computers. The original version of Hustle was written by Peter Trefonas and
plublished in CLOADM Magazine in 1979. The screen in the original game was
symmetrical while the MC-10 port uses an assymetrical screen due to the fact
the MC-10 has half the screen columns of the Model 1. The game is being
released as-is in hopes that someone in the MC-10 community can fix Color
Hustle as it does not work correctly. For some reason adding color to the
game breaks the code, causing the targets to be generated outside of the
playing field. The only thing I can think the problem is, is there is a bug
in Color Basic. For those who want to just play the game, you will want to
run Hustle as it works fine.
