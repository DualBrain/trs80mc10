Glenside CCC - CoCoFEST!

The 22nd Annual "Last" Chicago CoCoFEST!

Contact: Tony Podraza (President)

Glenside Cover Page
Back in 1983, Rainbow, the Color Computer magazine took a road trip from Prospect Kentucky to the windy city of Chicago. For 9 years, Lonnie Falk’s gang made the trek to create the Chicago RainbowFEST and bring 1,000's of CoCo users together in celebration.

After the final RainbowFest in 1991, the Glenside Color Computer user group said that we should have one more FEST so good friends could have one last celebration. So in 1992, the group put on “The "Last" Chicago CoCoFEST!“, sponsored by Dave and Nancy Myers of CoCoPRO! and to everyone's surprise, it was a hit.

What else could the group do but hold another show and call it “The Second Annual "Last" Chicago CoCoFEST!“

So, here we are (more than two decades later) with the 22nd Annual "Last" Chicago CoCoFEST! (With twice the number of shows that Rainbow Magazine did in Chicago.)

Welcome to the computer show that just wouldn't die! And why should it? It’s a celebration!

The dates this year are April 27 & 28, 2013. Tickets for this event are $5 per person at the door for the two-day event. Children 12 and younger - free.

Glenside CCC - CoCoFEST! - Vendors

CoCoFEST! Vendors

We will post each 2013 vendor as they become known.


			
	Aaron Wolfe -The 2013 CoCo Coding Contest    
The 2013 CoCo Coding Contest is a competitive but friendly event. Our goal is to encourage CoCo programming and bring recognition to new projects. Entries from first time programmers are just as welcome as those from veteran CoCo hackers and everyone in between. The winners of this year's contest will be announced at the CoCoFEST!.

			
		
			
	Bargeman Research Labs - Karl Sefcik   
Karl is a charter member/exhibitor of the CoCoFEST! For some time now he drivesw to and from the fest in a electric hybrid car. Karl exhibits, "Something new, something unusual." Drop by his booth and say, "HELLO".

Maybe the wild card display of the fest, it started with the only purpose of keeping the fest going. I'll have travel (Alaska) and print media info, etc. And then ya never know (the wild card factor). See ya there! Karl


			
		
			
	Brett M Gordon - CoCoBoot   
CoCoBoot is a stand-alone program written for the cira 1980's Tandy Color Computer 1,2 and 3. CoCoBoot is designed to be a flexible booting/BASIC replacement. It'll do more than boot your computer... CoCoBoot is a full Forth Programing Enviroment, with a hardy core of ITS OWN DEVICE DRIVERS.


			
		
			
	Cloud-9 - Mark Marlette   
Since 1994, Cloud-9 has been in the business of developing and marketing cool hardware and software products for users of the Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 1, Color Computer 2 and Tandy Color Computer 3. The company is made up of a couple of guys who get a kick pushing the CoCo beyond what it was originally designed to do.

			
		
			
	Dan Keller   
With a little luck I plan to have a TRS-80 CoCo clone to bring in and exhibit at CoCoFEST! to go along with the "CoCo clone" theme for this year.

			
		
			
	Frank Pittel   
Frank will demo his CoCoFPGA virtual Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer 3 (CoCo 3)

			
		
			
	Glenside MARK II IDE Interface - Brian Goers   
Updated version of the Glenside IDE Interface. The NEW manual and set-up disk requires no additional software to get your IDE Interface up and running right out of the box.

Just the manual and set-up disk are also available to users of our first version for update at a very low price.

			
		
			
	Griff-Art   
Cards, postcards, bookmarkers, jewelry and dreamcatchers.

			
		
			
	HAWKSoft   
CoCo3 RGB to S-Video adapters, CoCo Software and Hardware, CoCo X-10 Automation Hardware & Software, MM/1 Software and more...

Chris was also a partner in the development of LogiCall V7.0 for the CoCo.

  	Jim O'Keefe   
More to follow ...

			
		
			
	John & Marge Chasteen   
Be sure to buy a botton.

			
		
			
	John Mark Mobley   
John Mark and Melanie have put out the last 3 CoCo~123 newsletters. Please drop by their booth and let them know if you liked what you saw. John was the first to acquire a Raspberry Pi (aka CoCo 5). He was also a developer of LogiCall V7 for the CoCo 3, DriveWire 3/4 and Vcc.

			
		
			
	John W. Linville    FAHRFALL
John is the madman behind the digital video player for the CoCo 3. A father of three and a software developer in real-life, hobby hacking on the CoCo seems to him like a great way to stay sane. Rumor has it that John intends to release (or at least preview) a new arcade-style video game for the CoCo 1/2 platform at this year's CoCoFEST!.

	Liber809 Project - Boisy Pitre

	Lost Wizard Enterprises   
William Astle will be showing off the LWTOOLS assembler/linker package and maybe other stuff.

LWTOOLS is a set of cross-development tools for the Motorola 6809 and Hitachi 6309 microprocessors. It supports assembling to raw binaries, CoCo LOADM binaries, and a proprietary object file format for later linking. It also supports macros and file inclusion among other things.

	Mike Rowen of Hebron, KY   
Mike will bring free CoCo stickers and $6.00 coffee mugs. He will display assorted CoCos and hopefully a repack project.


			
		
			
	Nosko's Laser Show (Steve Noskowicz fiduciary)   
Steve Noskowicz will show us another one of his ever-popular CoCo Driven Laser Shows similar to his show for us back in 2002. Steve programs a CoCo to control galvanometers that move a laser beam to project images choreographed to music.

He will also have a few hardware tidbits such as Motorola MicroMocule development system CPU boards containing things like socketed 6800, 68000, PIA, Proms, etc.
