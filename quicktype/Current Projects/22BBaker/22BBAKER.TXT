YOU REMEMBER NOW: THE MAN HAD NOT BEEN VERY INTERESTING; BY HIS APPEARANCE YOU WERE ABLE TO DEDUCE THAT HE WAS A NERVOUS TALKER, AN ASPIRING COOK, A BACHELOR, AND THE OWNER OF TWO CATS.

GREASE STAINS ON THE COLLAR OF HIS JACKET SUGGEST HE ATE A DOUGHNUT THIS MORNING IN AFTER GETTING DRESSED, BUT BEFORE HE PUT ON HIS JACKET. THE SKIN UNDER HIS EYES INDICATES THAT HE DID THIS VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING, SO HE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE; YOU USUALLY EAT BREAKFAST TOGETHER. HE WOULDN'T EAT IT ALONE, AND HE ISN'T THE TYPE TO BUY DOUGHNUTS, SO HE MUST HAVE EATEN WITH SOMEONE ELSE. SUPERFICIAL CUTS ON HIS FACE INDICATE A HURRIED SHAVE JOB, SO HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT MISSING AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOMEONE FOR WHOM HE WAS EAGER TO LOOK HIS BEST. THE SCENT OF COFFEE IS ON HIS BREATH, AND HE HATES DRINKING COFFEE RIGHT AFTER BRUSHING HIS TEETH, SO HE MUST HAVE SKIPPED ON THAT TO SAVE TIME; IT WASN'T A ROMANTIC DATE, OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE BRUSHED HIS TEETH AND SKIPPED THE COFFEE. IT WAS A BUSINESS DATE. BUT WITH WHOM? YOU CAN TELL BY HIS SHOES THAT HE HASN'T LEFT THE FLAT. THAT RULES OUT MOST PEOPLE. SOME REMAINING DIRT REMAINS ON THE FLOOR FROM WHERE WHOEVER-IT-WAS KNOCKED OVER THE PLANTER IN THE CORNER. ONLY ONE PERSON COULD BE THAT CLUMSY: ANDERSON."

THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WRITING IS "[IF THE PLAYER IS NOT CARRYING THE MAGNIFYING GLASS]IT'S TOO SMALL TO READ.[OTHERWISE]YOU USE THE MAGNIFYING GLASS. IT SAYS, 'IN THE GRATE BENEATH THE BENCH.' WHAT COULD THAT MEAN?[END IF]".
INSTEAD OF SHOWING THE BOX TO JOHN WATSON, SAY "'HUH. HOW DID THAT GET THERE? IT'S LOCKED, THOUGH, SO IT'S NOT OF MUCH USE. I SUPPOSE YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND A KEY. HAVE YOU CHECKED EVERYWHERE IN THE HOUSE?' YOU DON'T KNOW WHY JOHN FEELS THE NEED TO STATE THE OBVIOUS."
INSTEAD OF SHOWING THE PHOTOGRAPHS TO JOHN WATSON, SAY "'WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE? THAT'S THE WOMAN FROM THE CASE ANDERSON TOLD ME ABOUT! SHE RECENTLY HAD A SET OF JEWELS STOLEN FROM HER HOUSE.

UNDERSTAND "ACID" AS THE CONTAINER OF ACID. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ACID IS "ONCE DILUTED, YOU CAN USE THIS AS A BUFFER FOR GEL ELECTROPHORESIS. IN ITS UNDILUTED FORM, HOWEVER, IT IS VERY CORROSIVE."
AFTER TAKING THE ACID, SAY "YOU TAKE THE ACID. NOT IN THAT WAY, THOUGH. YOU'RE DRUG-FREE...RIGHT NOW."

THE BEDROOM IS WEST OF BAKER STREET. "YOUR COLLEAGUE HAS FOLLOWED YOU INTO YOUR BEDROOM. HE'S CERTAINLY PERSISTENT. YOUR BED IS STILL UNMADE, THE WHITE SHEETS CRUMPLED OVER THE MATTRESS. A VIOLIN SITS IN THE CORNER. ATOP YOUR DRESSER ARE YOUR NICOTINE PATCHES AND YOUR MAGNIFYING GLASS. SITTING ON THE FLOOR IS THAT ODD DEERSTALKER HAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO LOVE." THE DEERSTALKER HAT IS IN THE BEDROOM. THE DEERSTALKER HAT IS WEARABLE. UNDERSTAND "HAT" AS DEERSTALKER HAT. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEERSTALKER HAT IS "A RIDICULOUS HAT. WOULD BE MORE USEFUL AS AN OVEN MITT."
INSTEAD OF SHOWING THE DEERSTALKER HAT TO JOHN WATSON, SAY "YOU EXASPERATEDLY EXPLAIN TO JOHN HOW RIDICULOUS THIS HAT IS. IT'S AN EAR-HAT. WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR, KILLING PEOPLE WITH ITS EAR-FLAPS? JOHN IGNORES YOUR PERFECTLY LOGICAL ARGUMENT AND INFORMS YOU THAT IT IS, IN FACT, A DEERSTALKER HAT."
AFTER WEARING THE DEERSTALKER HAT, SAY "GREAT. NOW YOU FEEL RIDICULOUS."
THE VIOLIN IS IN THE BEDROOM. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE VIOLIN IS "A BEAUTIFUL INSTRUMENT THAT YOU CHERISH DEEPLY. YOU PLAY A FEW BARS OF TCHAIKOVSKY'S 4TH SYMPHONY. JOHN WINCES AT THE SOUND; HE'S JUST AMAZED BY THE BEAUTY. SOMETHING DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT, THOUGH. THERE'S A RATTLING SOUND COMING FROM INSIDE THE VIOLIN. YOU SHOULD SEARCH THE INTERIOR." 
INSTEAD OF SHOWING THE VIOLIN TO JOHN WATSON, SAY "'I HATE THAT PIECE. STOP PLAYING THAT PIECE. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S TCHAIKOV-WHOEVER'S GREATEST WORK. AND YOUR VIOLIN SOUNDS WORSE THAN USUAL. I SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A PAPERCLIP STUCK INSIDE OR SOMETHING.' YOU DECIDE TO IGNORE HIS BLATANT DISREGARD FOR FINE ROMANTIC MUSIC AND CONSIDER WHAT HE HAS SAID ABOUT THE VIOLIN. IT DOES SOUND A BIT...OFF."
THE INTERIOR IS PART OF THE VIOLIN. THE SILVER KEY IS INSIDE THE INTERIOR. UNDERSTAND "INSIDE" AS THE INTERIOR. 
THE MAGNIFYING GLASS AND NICOTINE PATCHES ARE IN THE BEDROOM. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE NICOTINE PATCHES IS "YOU CAN'T CONCENTRATE WITHOUT THESE, BUT YOU DON'T NEED THEM RIGHT NOW."

THE SIDEWALK IS BELOW BAKER STREET. "YOU DESCEND THE STAIRS AND EXIT THE FLAT, JOHN FAITHFULLY AT YOUR SIDE. TRAFFIC CROWDS THE STREET IN FRONT OF YOU, PEDESTRIANS BUSILY GOING ABOUT THEIR DAYS. TO YOUR RIGHT IS A TREE, LOOKING WILTED IN THE OVERCAST, BITTER AIR. TO YOUR LEFT IS A WOODEN BENCH." THE TREE IS IN THE SIDEWALK. IT IS FIXED IN PLACE. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TREE IS "IT'S A SMALL TREE, BARELY MORE THAN A SAPLING. A LONG STRAND OF RED HAIR HANGS CURIOUSLY IN ONE OF THE LOWER BRANCHES. THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT HANGS SUGGESTS THAT SOMEONE WITH RED HAIR PASSED BY HERE, TOWARDS THE FLAT, RECENTLY." THE LONG RED HAIR IS ON THE TREE. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE LONG RED HAIR IS "A FINE RED HAIR, LIKELY A WOMAN'S. ITS TEXTURE INDICATES THAT IT IS OFTEN STRAIGHTENED AND STYLED, BUT WAS RECENTLY PUT INTO SOME SORT OF CONSTRICTING HAIRSTYLE, LIKE A BUN."
INSTEAD OF SHOWING THE HAIR TO JOHN WATSON, SAY "'HEY, THAT LOOKS FAMILIAR. I MET SOMEONE WITH RED HAIR RECENTLY...THAT'S RIGHT! LADY EDWARDS HAS RED HAIR! SHE MET WITH ANDERSON AND I THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE MISSING JEWELS.'"
THE BENCH IS IN THE SIDEWALK. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BENCH IS "A NORMAL WOODEN BENCH. ANDERSON MIGHT FIND IT SCINTILLATING." THE BENCH IS FIXED IN PLACE. THE GRATE IS PART OF THE BENCH. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GRATE IS "UNDERNEATH THE BENCH, THERE IS A METAL GRATE. SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE INSIDE IT, BUT YOU CAN'T FIT YOUR HAND THROUGH. YOU MUST OPEN IT SOMEHOW." THE GRATE IS AN OPENABLE AND CLOSED CONTAINER.
INSTEAD OF OPENING THE GRATE WHEN THE PLAYER IS NOT CARRYING THE ACID, SAY "YOU CAN'T OPEN THE GRATE. MAYBE YOU CAN BREAK THE METAL SOMEHOW."
AFTER OPENING THE GRATE WHEN THE PLAYER IS CARRYING THE ACID, SAY "YOU USE THE ACID TO CORRODE AND WEAKEN THE METAL, BUT IT'S STILL TOO HOT TO TOUCH. YOU CAN SEE A BIT OF FOIL INSIDE. YOU CAN TRY TO TAKE IT, BUT YOU CAN'T UNTIL YOU HAVE SOMETHING--ANY CLOTH WILL DO--TO PROTECT YOUR HANDS." THE FOIL IS IN THE GRATE.
INSTEAD OF TAKING THE FOIL WHEN THE PLAYER IS WEARING THE HAT, SAY "YOU NEED SOMETHING TO PROTECT YOUR HANDS."
INSTEAD OF TAKING THE FOIL WHEN THE PLAYER IS NOT CARRYING THE HAT, SAY "YOU NEED SOMETHING TO PROTECT YOUR HANDS."
AFTER TAKING THE FOIL, SAY "YOU USE THE RIDICULOUS HAT TO PROTECT YOUR HANDS FROM THE STILL-HOT METAL. YOU TAKE THE FOIL." THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FOIL IS "A PIECE OF REFLECTIVE FOIL, INSCRIBED WITH THE NUMBERS '34-12-4-5-32-5-5-5-31-22-23-30-13-30-35-34' IT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME CIPHER AS ON THE SLIP OF PAPER IN THE DESK.[IF THE PLAYER IS NOT CARRYING THE SLIP OF PAPER]BUT EVEN YOU CAN'T JUST SOLVE THIS CIPHER. IT'S INCOMPLETE. YOU NEED THE OTHER HALF FROM THE DESK DRAWER.[OTHERWISE]YOU USE JOHN'S LAPTOP TO DO SOME RESEARCH. ALL OF THE NUMBERS IN THE CIPHER ARE BASE 6--THIS YOU ALREADY KNEW. HOWEVER, WHEN CONVERTED TO BASE 10, THEY STILL DON'T MAKE SENSE: BOTH BITS OF CODE ARE COMPLETE NONSENSE. BUT IF YOU COMBINE THEM IN JUST THE RIGHT WAY--ALTERNATING LETTERS BETWEEN ONE AND THE OTHER--THEY FORM THE MESSAGE: 'I'VE HIDDEN THE JEWELS IN YOUR MICROWAVE.' THERE MUST BE A SECRET COMPARTMENT IN THE MICROWAVE. YOU SHOULD EXAMINE IT.[END IF]".
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPARTMENT IS "A SMALL COMPARTMENT ON THE BACK OF THE MICROWAVE WITH FOUR SCREWS HOLDING THE COVER IN PLACE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT CAN BE OPENED."
INSTEAD OF SHOWING THE SILVER KEY TO JOHN WATSON, SAY "'WHERE DO THESE THINGS KEEP COMING FROM? IT LOOKS LIKE IT CAN UNLOCK SOMETHING WITH A SILVER KEYHOLE.' JOHN, MUST YOU REALLY STATE THE OBVIOUS CONSTANTLY?"
UNDERSTAND "PHOTOS" AS PHOTOGRAPHS.
INSTEAD OF SHOWING THE FOIL TO JOHN WATSON, SAY "'IT'S THE SAME CIPHER AS BEFORE! MAYBE IT'S THE KEY OR SOMETHING.'" 
UNDERSTAND "SECRET COMPARTMENT" AS COMPARTMENT.
AFTER TAKING THE JEWELS: SAY "'GOODNESS! THAT WAS TOO EASY FOR YOU.' YOU TURN AROUND TO SEE THAT A RED-HAIRED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWED YOU INSIDE. HER WRIST INDICATES EXCESSIVE BADMINTON PLAYING. SAFFRON STAINS ON HER FINGERS SUGGEST A LOVE OF THE CULINARY ARTS. A FEW FINE HAIRS ON HER SKIRT IMPLY THAT SHE IS THE OWNER OF TWO CATS. 'WELL, IF IT ISN'T LADY EDWARDS, WHOSE JEWELS WENT MISSING YESTERDAY. YOU DID ALL OF THIS JUST TO TEST ME?' YOU SAY. 'EVEN DRESSING AS A MAN--WITH A WIG TO HIDE YOUR HAIR--SO THAT YOU COULD GIVE ME THE FIRST HALF OF THE CIPHER? WHAT WAS THE POINT?' SHE MAKES AN IMPATIENT GESTURE AND REPLIES, 'I WAS BORED. I HAD ACCESS TO YOUR FLAT WHILE MEETING WITH DR. WATSON AND MR. ANDERSON. IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT THEY WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION AND YOU WEREN'T EVEN AWAKE YET. BESIDES, MY PARENTS WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME COMPENSATION FOR THE JEWELS.' YOU CONTEMPLATE WHETHER TO RETURN THE JEWELS TO THIS WOMAN, AND ULTIMATELY HAND THEM OVER. 'THEY'RE USELESS TO ME,' YOU SAY. 'I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO WITH THEM. JUST GET OUT OF MY FLAT. I'VE GOT TO GO TO MY MIND PALACE.'"; END THE GAME IN VICTORY.
