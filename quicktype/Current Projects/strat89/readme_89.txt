Wow, Version 2.0 is here after more than a year!!  I have spent a lot
of time improving the design and this is so much better than previous
versions.

The best improvements for v2.0 are the single map display, selection,
and battle routines.  These not only save memory but are faster as
well.  Though there are more files, the memory used has actually
been reduced.  Also a new save game method has been added that saves
stats as well as the game pieces.  You can also give a description
for your saved game.  Older 1.x saved games ARE compatible. My
favorite is the new map display.  The map is drawn piece by piece only
once, and from then on it is instantly displayed on the screen.

For a complete history of Stratego 89, check out the history.89t file.

By the way, the pos#p#'s are for you to load your positions, so you
don't have to place the pieces one-by-one. They are for player 1 and
player 2.  For example, pos1p2 is for player 2.

The program randpos will create a random position file.  Simply use
a 1 or 2 after randpos( to create a file.  Note:  Position files and
saved game files are automatically given names.  You can rename them
if you like.

The game is very customizable, just choose options from the main menu
to change the options to suit yourself.

If you haven't played this game before DON'T WORRY!! Instructions
are included in the game and can even be read during the game!!  And
the calculator knows all the rules so you won't need to keep track of
them all.
