103 R$=R$+" You are standing in a well-lit forest (as opposed to a dark one?). Beams of light penetrate the canopy above, casting"

106 R$=R$+" You are north of the forest on a gravel path. It snakes downhill towards a small valley (northeast). On the distant"

108 DATA 4,1,0,16: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
109 R$=R$+" You are walking downhill on a path through a green valley (green like spinach, popeye?). The rumble of thunder grows"
110 R$=R$+" ever closer, as a storm moves in a from the northeast (we're such trend setters here in Fetter's Grim!). The path leads to a small village (no shit?)."
111 DATA 0,0,4,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
112 R$=R$+" (Hey, I'm drunk! WHEEEEEEE! Oops, sorry...back to the, uh, game!) You are standing on the outskirts of Doria, a small village nestled"
113 R$=R$+" in a narrow valley (near snow capped mountains). The spires of a cathedral are visible west, while a fountain is north (El Dorado...why don't you come to your senses? You're out finding gold and...oh, sorry)."
114 DATA 5,2,0,3: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
115 R$=R$+" You stand before a granite fountain near the center of town (ok, I lied...it's a !#$%^&* [bleep] village...happy now? The Elf Gods are pissed!). Ahem. A statue of a spring maiden, from"
116 R$=R$+" (flips through dictionary)...Celtic Lore...pours water from an upheld jar into a shallow basin below. West is a cathedral (or Hell, I guess?)."
117 DATA 8,4,0,6: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
118 R$=R$+" You close the doors soundly behind you as you enter the church. Several rows of wooden pews dominate the interior, while"
119 R$=R$+" towering stained glass windows illuminate the interior in a kaleidoscope of ('Brilliant!') colors. An altar stands to the north, just beyond a large crucifix."
120 DATA 7,0,5,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
121 R$=R$+" You are facing a wooden altar near the back of the cathedral. Ceramic bowls, covered bywhite clothes and overpowering your senses with the poignant odor of wine, rest near the center"

123 DATA 14,6,0,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
124 R$=R$+" You are walking on a stone path near the entrance to 'Fetter's Grim,' a local dive with a myriad of Eelpots hanging down from the roof. Ruffians"

127 R$=R$+" (I must be a doctor, because I can't read my @#$@#%$ handwrit...oops sorry!) You have entered into the musty, dark hallows of Fetter's Grim, a local dive of dancing Ailuropoda wannabees. Outlaws of all"
128 R$=R$+" backgrounds eye you warily from across the room (some of them bloody drunk, obviously), as faint candlelight struggles against the choking darkness. A bartender pours drinks, while a pair of soldiers stand beside him, their swords at th

131 DATA 0,9,0,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
132 R$=R$+" You are east of the main path. A small cottage stands before you, sporting a terraced roof and a riddled frame, proving a stark contrast to the dingy trappings"
133 R$=R$+" of the surrounding colonies of the village. There is a cave to the west (but it cannot be reached from here -- you must go around somehow)."
134 DATA 0,0,12,8: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
135 R$=R$+" You are inside a small cottage. The last remnants of a small fire smolder in a peculiar light, as logs are stacked neatly beside the fireplace (set into the western wall). A tiny room,"

137 DATA 0,13,0,11: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
138 R$=R$+" You brush past the sheets, ducking into a tiny room. It is mostly bare, save for a"

140 DATA 12,0,0,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
141 R$=R$+" You are standing to the north of the cathedral facing a secluded alcove. At the back of the alcove stands a large oak tree, its withered branches nearly bare and rotting off. Behind the tree lies a"

143 DATA 0,7,0,15: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
144 R$=R$+" You are inside the borders of a small cemetary (near the church). A few grave markers are here, some of them engraved with ancient"
145 R$=R$+" occultic symbols. The largest one, in the very back of the cemetary on lone hill, reads simply: 'V.H.HAMMOND 46-24'."
146 DATA 0,0,14,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
147 R$=R$+" You are on a path heading west (out of town, obviously). Large, towering cliffs stand to the north, overlooking a white, sandy beach. There is a"

149 DATA 0,0,2,17: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
150 R$=R$+" You are west of the cliffs on a white, sandy beach. A warm breeze blows against your face,"
151 R$=R$+" as the rays of the setting sun dance upon the water ahead. A lone man is here, molding a sculpture from wet sand near the shore."
152 DATA 18,0,16,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
153 R$=R$+" You are standing on a white beach with a tall, beared man (who seems to like playing with sand, apparently). He is wearing a white robe and appears"
154 R$=R$+" to be molding a bird out of wet sand near the water's edge (ok, if he did this on the cliff I'd be worried! Jesus is not a base jumper...or a base player, for that matter...but I digress.) He says to you,'We are like birds. Do you not s
R$=R$+"ee the truth in these words, or are you obscured by the"
R$=R$+"  serphant of the saints?'"
155 DATA 21,17,19,22: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
156 R$=R$+" You wander further east, as the strange man lectures you on nutrition and servitude (who does this guy think he is? Judas Priest?). He points to the cliff rock ahead, saying"
157 R$=R$+" in a whisper: 'From the sea, I draw fish, but from the cliffs, I am given life!' As you ponder this Jesus-babble, he takes a seashell and listens to it carefully. Handing it back to you, he replies,'Let us whisper to the Father, so he m
R$=R$+"ay hear us...'"
158 DATA 0,0,20,18: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
159 R$=R$+" You follow the strange man into a nearby cave at the base of the cliffs. A large terracotta lamp rests atop a flat stone near the back, providing amble"
160 R$=R$+" lighting for the small cave. You notice vague, incoherent writings upon the walls, some of which you know nothing about. Cruce drawings, painted in berry juice, flummox you further. These drawings, which are opposite the strange script,
R$=R$+" appear to depict fishing activities along the shore. "
R$=R$+" From afar, the voice of Jesus says to you quietly,'I have come here 'lo these many years, for it is the sanctuary of my father, Abba.'"
161 DATA 0,0,0,19: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
162 R$=R$+" You are walking north of the cliffs on the beach. A small fishing boat is docked here, rocked gently by the waning tide. Inside the boat rests an old"
163 R$=R$+" fishing net, somewhat torn and tangled with seaweed."
164 DATA 23,18,0,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
165 R$=R$+" You wander west. The man stops sculpting abruply and looks up at you, saying,'When all the world hates you, strike at it not with"
166 R$=R$+" spears or swords, but with sage words and heavenly deeds!' Just then it begins to dawn on you who this strange man really is: he is Jesus, hailing from Galilee. You heard he was a rabblerouser, but those were mostly rumors. He appears r
R$=R$+"ather feeble, actually, and furthermore he "
R$=R$+" appears as a sheepherder, tending his flock at sunset."
167 DATA 0,0,18,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
168 R$=R$+" You walk north into the shallow waters by the beach. The man tosses a small fish at your feet from behind. As you turn around, he simply smiles at you."
169 R$=R$+" Such is the man they call Jesus..."
170 DATA 0,21,0,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
171 R$=R$+" You are west of the main forest in a decaying woodland. Dozens of rotted trees block your path ahead, as"
172 R$=R$+" as a sinister howl sends a shiver down your spine. A wilted rose-bush slumps near the base of an old tree (to the north). A corpseman leans againt it, playing a haunting tune on an old lute."
173 DATA 25,0,1,25: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
174 R$=R$+" You are by the old tree, struck by the hypnotic melody played by the corpseman (holding a wooden lute). His eyes seem to pierce your skin,"
175 R$=R$+" stabbing your very soul with one-thousand jagged knives ('Desperado...why don't you come to your senses?'). You notice a lone rosebush here, glowing in the darkness."
176 DATA 0,24,24,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
177 R$=R$+" You are walking south of the dying forest, just past a well-guarded Roman fortress. Black smoke billows overhead, drifting over"
178 R$=R$+" from funeral pyres west of the main compound (not accessible from here). The stench of burnt flesh is overwhelming here."
179 DATA 1,27,0,30: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
180 R$=R$+" You are at the entrance to a Roman fortress. A pair of soliders, standing on either side of the gate, stand ready to impale"
181 R$=R$+" you with razor-sharp swords should you draw the ire of the Gods."
182 DATA 26,0,28,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
183 R$=R$+" You are standing inside the Roman fortress, a small encampment near the edge of the forest. Embers aflame drift haphazardly in a stiff breeze, encircling the camp with the quiet fury of Hell. A large"
184 R$=R$+" tent is visible just up ahead (to the north), near some stray dogs that are chasing one another."
185 DATA 29,0,31,27: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
186 R$=R$+" You push aside purple drapes as you enter the main tent. Marble busts of Roman Gods -- ok, Goddesses -- adorn the interior, as baskets of fruit and pouches of wine rest idly on table nearby. A couple of"
187 R$=R$+" Praetorians are here, engaged in deep conversation, but that stops immediately once they notice your obviously unwelcome presence! Drawing their swords, they charge at you with hatred in their eyes and malice in their hearts!"
188 DATA 0,28,32,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
189 R$=R$+" You are by a small river just west of the Roman encampment. A woman is here, washing her linens in the slowing moving water of the nearby creek. She looks"
190 R$=R$+" up at you only briefly, with hollow eyes and a piercing stare."
191 DATA 0,0,26,0: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
192 R$=R$+" You are walking east of the main camp. Several men are here, fencing with swords. The largest one, named Darius and wearing a feather"
193 R$=R$+" atop his helmet, suddenly pulls his sword from his sheath, never waving his steely gaze upon your horrified eyes! It is clear without uttering a sound what he plans to do to you!"
194 DATA 0,0,0,28: IF SI = 1 THEN RETURN
195 R$=R$+" You walk past the table into a secluded antechamber of the tent. Faint lighting from candles provide just enough lighting to see the vague outline of a man seated"
196 R$=R$+" at a large table, writing feverishly on scattered parchments. He is old and quite frail-looking, but nevertheless has a very regal appearance, his hand much steadier than the rest of his body. He looks up at you momentarily before retur
R$=R$+"ning to his dull, mindless task. Before you can "
R$=R$+" speak, however, a guard races into the room and points a long blade at your throat. 'Hail Caesar!', he snarls at you."
