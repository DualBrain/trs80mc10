   This a version of the games sokoban, converted from the sources foundon usenet to os9 level II for the coco III.   Included are sources, and itwouldn't be too difficult to make it run under os9 level I.  I wrote a smallsubset of curses that makes such conversions easier.   To install, unpack the archive and put the file sokoban in your execution directory and set the attributes to e and pe.  Create a directory where you will run the program (several scratch files are used by sokoban).  Within that directory create another subdirectory, SCREENS.  Put the 50 screens in the SCREENS subdirectory.  Sokoban can be run with several options.  The firsttime you run it, use the -c option to create a score file:    sokoban -c    From then on, whenever a player exits, the last successfully completedscreen number is saved so the next time s/he plays, the program starts fromwhere the player left off.  To see all the options type:    sokoban -?    Other options are to see the current rankings:    sokoban -s    To restore a saved game:    sokoban -r    To start from any arbitrary screen:    sokoban -nn where nn is a number > 0 and < 51.    Run the program and type ? for complete instructions.   This is a *very*addicting game in spite of being so simple.      Tom Napolitano    70215,1130
