<H3>Game Rules</H3>
<P>
      <B>Stratego </B>is a famous board game that has been around for many years.
      Here is an overview of the rules for those who are not familiar with
      them.
<P>
      The game is played on a board consisting of ten by ten squares. Each
      player has forty tiles which are placed upon the lower half of the
      board. Each of these tiles has a certain value and move capability.
      The value of a tile is symbolized by an army rank. In the table below
      is an overview of the tiles and their capabilities. The <I>Amount </I>column
      shows the number of tiles you have of each type.

      Eight board positions are designated as water. Nobody can swim. The
      object of the game is to take your opponents flag. The values of your
      opponents tiles are (of course) not visible to you.
<P>
      The players now take turns. There are two type of moves, moving or
      attacking a tile. A move consists of moving a tile horizontal or
      vertical. Diagonal moves are not permitted. When you attack an enemy
      tile, both the attacking and attacked tile will reveil their value.
      Normally the highest rank will win (see table) and the other tile will
      be taken off the board. If you attack the enemy and win, your tile
      will take the enemies tile position on the board.
      The game has ended if one of the following cases occur:
<UL>
      <LI>The flag of one of the players is taken. The winner is the one who's flag is still standing.

      <LI>One of the players can no longer make a valid move. This player will have lost the game.

      <LI>One of the players aborts.

      <LI> * NOT YET IMPLEMENTED* If the same board setup occurs three times, without a tile being
           taken on either side the game is said to have ended in remise.
           Stratego will warn you whenever a board setup occurs for the
           second time. It will ask for confirmation for the move that will
           end the game in remise.
