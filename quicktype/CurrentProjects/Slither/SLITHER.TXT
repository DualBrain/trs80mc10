DISK C0L0RC0M/E 



The Intelligent Communications Package 

C0L0RC0M/E, the most popular smart terminal program for the Color Com- 
puter, has just gotten smarter. In fact, from now on, we're going to call it The 
intelligent Terminal program. 

The new DISK COLORCOM/E contains a unique COMMAND MODE that 
allows you to set up complete communications sessions in advance. Anything 
you normally do from the keyboard DISK COLORCOM/E can do all by itself. 
Log-on, log-off, read and store messages, disconnect, transmit and receive 
files, dial auto-dial modems,- anything! DISK COLORCOM/E will even make 
decisions based upon how the host responds. 

Here are some examples of how YOU might want to use the new DISK 
COLORCOM/E. 

• Call your favorite bulletin board, download all messages addressed to 
you, log off, and write the messages to adisk file. AND do all of this with 
one keystroke! 

• Call Dow Jones, log on and get the latest prices on your favorite stocks, 
and then log off. Again all with ONE keystroke. 

• With an Autodial modem let COLORCOM/E Make your calls for you at 
3:00 A.M. when rates are cheap. Then read the results with your morn- 
ing coffee. 

In addition we've added 64K support and your choice of number of characters 
per line. Of course you still get the regular COLORCOM/E features such as 
upload/download, graphics, easy storing and printing of data, and much more. 
For 16, 32 or 64K disk systems. 

COLORCOM/E Disk $49.95
